  <h3 class="tesla-gray text-center"><em>10 World Changing Inventions:</em></h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Alternating Current</strong> - Winner of the 1893 G.E. - Westinhouse feud, this system developed by Tesla, generates power and distribution throughout North America.</li>
    <li><strong>Light</strong> - While he didn't invent light itself, Tesla did invent how it could be harnessed and distributed. Tesla developed flourecent bulbs in his lab 40 years before the rest of the industry was using them.</li>
    <li><strong>X-Rays</strong> - Ever had an x-ray before? Well thank Tesla for that one too! While researched heavily in the 1800's, Tesla is responsible for researching the entire spectrum that lead to eventual inventing of the x-ray.</li>
    <li><strong>Radio</strong> - In 1943, the Supreme Court overturned a patent for Guglielmo Marconi after it was proven Tesla invented the radio years prior.</li>
    <li><strong>Remote Control</strong> - A relative of radio, in 1898 the first remote controlled model boat was demonstrated. Tesla used several large batteries, along with radio signals controlled by switches. These switches would then power the boat’s propeller, rudder and even it's running lights fitted to scale!</li>
    <li><strong>Electric Motor</strong> - Have you seen one of those cars driving around town brandishing his name? Tesla's electric motor can also be found in industrial fans, household applicances, water pumps, machine and power tools just to name a few.</li>
    <li><strong>Robotics</strong> - Tesla is quoted saying “I have by every thought and act of mine, demonstrated, and does so daily, to my absolute satisfaction that I am an automaton endowed with power of movement, which merely responds to external stimuli.” This statement shows that Tesla was thinking about the concept of robotics. He envinsioned a future of automated vehicles, robotic human companions, an numerous other automated sensors and devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Lasers</strong> - It is undeniable that the invention of the laser has helped mankind in infinately positive ways. Think for a moment the many facets where lasers are used in our modern society today. Lasers are used in surgery, construction, or the military machines and defense systems. They are even being developed as directed energy weapons. Now that's science-fiction turning into realty.</li>
    <li><strong>Wireless Communications</strong> - J.P. Morgan funded Tesla so that he might build the world's first tower that used natural frequencies to transmit data. This data included information in the form of images, voice messages, and text.</li>
    <li><strong>Limitless Free Energy</strong> - Aside from the cost of Tesla's wireless tower, he had proven that the universe is filled with energy that can be harnessed and utilized to create a world wide web to connect people everywhere. The best part about this natural occuring frequency? It's free!</li>
